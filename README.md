This starter project is an adaptation of the original [Flightdeck](https://github.com/flight-deck/Flightdeck) project that leverages [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for its static site generation and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for all compiling and bundling of assets.

There is also a [ParcelJS version](https://github.com/flight-deck/flightdeck-jekyll-parcel), but this uses parcel v1.

## Inspiration and Folder Structure ðŸ¤”

Like pervious Flightdeck versions for [Jekyll](https://github.com/flight-deck/Flightdeck-Jekyll/) and [Hugo](https://github.com/flight-deck/Flightdeck-Hugo) each project's objective is to create consistent workflow and reusability of code from project to project. Which was described by JÃ©rÃ´me CoupÃ©'s article [Structuring Eleventy Projects](https://www.webstoemp.com/blog/eleventy-projects-structure/). Over-time, this will shift as ideas change but 2022, we are shamelessly borrowing concept, structure, and conventions JÃ©rÃ´me CoupÃ© outlines.

## Installation & Usage

#### Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ginfuru/Flightdeck-11ty.git
```

#### Install Dependencies

**Optional Opinion** â€“ Personally, [I](https://github.cim/edheltzel) like having eleventy installed globally, only because I have traveled without a reliable data connection and had some unexpected results with dependencies, but the official docs suggest using `npx`

> You can swap `npm` in favor of `yarn`
